# Learning Conjunctions of Horn Clauses

An example implementation of the Paper "Learning Conjunctions of Horn Clauses" by Angluin et al. (https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1022689015665)

Currently only the first (unoptimized) algorithm is implemented and the equivalence query is only implemented by brute-force.
