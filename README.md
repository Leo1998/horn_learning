# Learning Conjunctions of Horn Clauses

An example implementation of the Paper "Learning Conjunctions of Horn Clauses" by Angluin et al. (https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1022689015665)

Both algorithms `HORN` and `HORN1` are implemented and fully functional.
NOTE: the equivalence query is only implemented by brute-force. (A `PTIME` algorithm would theoretically be available)
